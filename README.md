# Canvas2ImagePlugin

This plugin allows you to save the contents of an HTML canvas tag to the iOS Photo Library and Android Gallery from your app.

## Original Plugin

This Plugin is a fork of 'https://github.com/rodrigograca31/Canvas2ImagePlugin' .

## Installation

`cordova plugin add https://github.com/yiharng/Canvas2ImagePlugin`

For iOS, you will need to add the following to your config.xml file within `<platform name="ios">`:

```xml
<edit-config file="*-Info.plist" mode="merge" target="NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription">
    <string>Description goes here.</string>
</edit-config>
```

## Usage:

Call the `window.canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary()` method using success and error callbacks and the id attribute or the element object of the canvas to save:

### Example

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="165px" height="145px"></canvas>
```

```javascript
function onDeviceReady() {
	window.canvas2ImagePlugin.saveImageDataToLibrary(
		function(msg) {
			console.log(msg);
		},
		function(err) {
			console.log(err);
		},
		document.getElementById("myCanvas"),// You can also use base64 strings 
		"jpeg" ,// format is optional, defaults to 'png'
		"[directory]" ,// [directory] is optional, The file will be stored in /storage/emulated/0/Pictures/[directory] 
		"[file name]" ,// [file name] is optional,

}
```
